                Since 1953, businessman Javier Herrera and his wife, Mrs. Ramona Baeza, have operated the successful “Santa Teresita” Bakery, 
                an establishment that soon became a landmark in the community. From its earliest days, the bakery has stood out for maintaining traditional recipes, 
                an artisanal process, and a deep commitment to quality. This 100% Yucatecan company has been, since its inception, a symbol of hard work, dedication, and family values.

                Today, 72 years after its founding, Jocabet Herrera and Gerardo Herrera Jr., grandsons of Mr. Javier and Mrs. Ramona, 
                proudly continue the legacy their grandparents began, maintaining their commitment to preserving the unique and unparalleled flavor of traditional wood-fired bread.

                With dedication and respect for the original recipes, they have honored the family tradition, ensuring that the essence, quality, 
                and warmth that have always characterized the bakery remain present in every product they offer their customers.
